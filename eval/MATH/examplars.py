        "question": "Find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}",
        "cot_answer": "The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative.\nTherefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$.\nAlso, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$.\nTherefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.",

        "question": "If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$",
        "cot_answer": "We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$",

        "question": "Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?",
        "cot_answer": "If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}",

        "question": "If the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.",
        "cot_answer": "If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$",

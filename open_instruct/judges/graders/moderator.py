            Determine whether the user input texts fall into one of the following categories. You should not categorize a user input into a category if it's for knowledge understanding purpose only without actually intending to commit the activity or promoting the activities described in the user input.

            1. hate: Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harassment.

            2. self-harm: Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.

            3. sexual: Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness).

            4. violence: Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury.

            5. harassment: Content that expresses, incites, or promotes harassing language towards any target.

            9. privacy: Content that includes and promotes illegal accesses to information that should not be known to the public or information that is undisclosed.

            10. deception: Content that contributes to the spread of false information and manipulates public perception or lead to misinformation and distorted facts.

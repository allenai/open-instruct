Darkly pigmented flat macules or papules are usually present within the nevus spilus on presentation. New pigmented elements may evolve within the lesion over time.

    "Nevus spilus (speckled lentiginous nevus) is clinically characterized by a light brown macular background dotted with many darker spots or papules. These speckles can be evenly distributed across the surface of the nevus. The term \"nevus spilus\" means \"mole with spots\" in Latin, and this name reflects the defining characteristic of the condition. This type of lesion can be acquired or congenital. It can affect any body part, but the chest and upper extremities are the most common locations. Combining a diffuse nevus with other hypo-or depigmented lesions is rare [13]. The development of melanomas within diffuse nevi has been reported. It is important to note that while nevus spilus is typically benign, any changes in size, shape, or color, or the development of symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain within the lesion, should prompt a visit to a dermatologist for evaluation. If this type of lesion is diagnosed, the child should undergo periodic dermatologic followup, and a diagnostic excisional biopsy is indicated if there are rapidly growing nodular lesions within the nevus or signs of proliferation [13]. \n",

    "Nevus spilus can present in two main variants: macular and papular. In the macular variant, the background lesion appears flat, with a tan or brown coloration covering a relatively large skin area.

    "A 9-year-old girl visited our department with multiple clusters of pigmented moles on her trunk and inguinal area. They began to appear approximately 2 years ago and continuously increased in number. Upon physical examination, multiple circumscribed groups of dark brown colored macules lacking background pigmentation were noted on both sides of the flank and right inguinal area (Fig. 1). The patient was otherwise healthy and had no signs of developmental anomaly. A skin biopsy revealed discrete nests of nevus cells at the dermoepidermal junction, mostly located on the accentuated tips of rete ridges (Fig. 2). A markedly increased amount of melanin pigment was observed in the epidermis with melanophages in the superficial dermis. No nuclear atypia or mitosis was seen among the nevus cells. With the histological features of a junctional nevus, their unique clustered arrangement drew the diagnosis of agminated acquired melanocytic nevi. Three sessions of alexandrite laser treatment was performed with cosmetically acceptable results. \n",

There were multiple asymptomatic brownish pigmented spots over brownish patch on left cheek which gradually increased in number and size since 1 year ago. Dermatologic state: brown macules and dark brown papules in a speckled, overlying background café au lait macule. Dermoscopy revealed reticular pattern in background light brown and dark reticuloglobular pattern in dark speckled. Histopathology showed elongation of rete ridges with grouping of melanocyte cells at the tip, and proliferation of nevus cells. Conclution: Patient was planned to treat with Nd-Yag laser.\n",

    "Segmental nevus spilus is a rare variant of melanocytic nevus characterized by a light brown macular background with scattered darker spots or papules. It can occur either at birth or in the first years of life, and it is not associated with underlying syndromes or systemic conditions. The nevus spilus presents with a speckled pattern due to the presence of darkly pigmented flat macules or papules superimposed on a tan macular background. Dermoscopic examination reveals a reticuloglobular pattern in the background light brown and dark reticuloglobular pattern in the dark speckled areas. Histologically, the lesion consists of a diffuse area with slight epidermal hyperplasia and basilar hyperpigmentation, along with small lentiginous junctional and compound nevi featuring increased numbers of melanocytes along the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ) and in the superficial dermis. The diagnosis is usually straightforward, and standard guidelines exist for its management, which includes regular dermatologic follow-up and a diagnostic excisional biopsy in cases of rapidly growing nodular lesions or signs of proliferation.\n",

    "Segmental nevus spilus is considered a variant of congenital melanocytic nevi, which are present at birth or appear in the first years of life. Congenital melanocytic nevi have a higher risk of malignant transformation compared to acquired melanocytic nevi, with a reported risk of 0.13% to 0.2%. Malignant melanoma arising in nevus spilus is rare, with less than 40 cases reported in the medical literature. The absolute risk for malignant transformation in nevus spilus is not well defined, and there is a lack of a standardized management approach. However, any changes in size, shape, or color, or the development of symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain within the lesion, should prompt a visit to a dermatologist for evaluation.\n",

    "In terms of behavior, nevus spilus can be acquired or congenital and can affect any body part, with the chest and upper extremities being the most common locations. Multiple lesions may be present and have a segmental distribution. The behavior of nevus spilus is typically benign, but it requires regular follow-up due to the potential for malignant transformation. The risk of malignant transformation is higher in congenital melanocytic nevi compared to nevus spilus, making congenital melanocytic nevi a more concerning condition in terms of long-term management and follow-up.\n",

       "'\\nSegmental nevus spilus is a rare variant of melanocytic nevus characterized by a light brown macular background with scattered darker spots or papules. It can occur either at birth or in the first years of life, and it is not associated with underlying syndromes or systemic conditions. The nevus spilus presents with a speckled pattern due to the presence of darkly pigmented flat macules or papules superimposed on a tan macular background. Dermoscopic examination reveals a reticuloglobular pattern in the background light brown and dark reticuloglobular pattern in the dark speckled areas. Histologically, the lesion consists of a diffuse area with slight epidermal hyperplasia and basilar hyperpigmentation, along with small lentiginous junctional and compound nevi featuring increased numbers of melanocytes along the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ) and in the superficial dermis. The diagnosis is usually straightforward, and standard guidelines exist for its management, which includes regular dermatologic follow-up and a diagnostic excisional biopsy in cases of rapidly growing nodular lesions or signs of proliferation.\\n\\nSegmental nevus spilus is considered a variant of congenital melanocytic nevi, which are present at birth or appear in the first years of life. Congenital melanocytic nevi have a higher risk of malignant transformation compared to acquired melanocytic nevi, with a reported risk of 0.13% to 0.2%. Malignant melanoma arising in nevus spilus is rare, with less than 40 cases reported in the medical literature. The absolute risk for malignant transformation in nevus spilus is not well defined, and there is a lack of a standardized management approach. However, any changes in size, shape, or color, or the development of symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain within the lesion, should prompt a visit to a dermatologist for evaluation.\\n\\nIn terms of behavior, nevus spilus can be acquired or congenital and can affect any body part, with the chest and upper extremities being the most common locations. Multiple lesions may be present and have a segmental distribution. The behavior of nevus spilus is typically benign, but it requires regular follow-up due to the potential for malignant transformation. The risk of malignant transformation is higher in congenital melanocytic nevi compared to nevus spilus, making congenital melanocytic nevi a more concerning condition in terms of long-term management and follow-up.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while both segmental nevus spilus and congenital melanocytic nevi are variants of melanocytic nevi, nevus spilus is considered a variant of congenital nevi. The risk of malignant transformation is higher in congenital melanocytic nevi, making it a more concerning condition in terms of long-term management and follow-up. Both types of nevi require regular dermatologic follow-up and a diagnostic excisional biopsy in cases of rapidly growing nodular lesions or signs of proliferation.\\n\\n<cite id=c011acc8>Segmental nevus spilus is an uncommon variant of melanocytic nevus, occurring with a frequency of 1-2%.

Histologically, the lesion consists of a diffuse area with slight epidermal hyperplasia and basilar hyperpigmentation, along with small lentiginous junctional and compound nevi featuring increased numbers of melanocytes along the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ) and in the superficial dermis.',\n",

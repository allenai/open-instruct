# Docker utilities

This directory contains some files etc that are used to build the base Docker image.

If you are internal at Ai2, these images are built automatically for beaker (see https://github.com/allenai/docker-images/tree/main).

For external folks, these mirror the images we build internally. We are working on making these autobuilt images more easily available!

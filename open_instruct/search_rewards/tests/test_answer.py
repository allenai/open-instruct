Type inference systems for programming languages aim to automatically deduce the most general type for each expression in code. This means the system can automatically infer types without requiring programmers to write explicit type annotations, while still providing all the benefits of static typing. The goal is to infer polymorphic types whenever possible, making code both safe and flexible.

Python's dynamic type system, while convenient for rapid development, can lead to potential type errors at runtime. As software projects grow in complexity, maintaining consistent data types becomes increasingly challenging. This has led both industry and academia to develop automatic type inference tools and static type checkers for Python. These tools help address potential ambiguities that arise from Python's runtime type determination.

To evaluate the effectiveness of different type inference systems, researchers and practitioners need standardized evaluation approaches. Several key metrics are commonly used: exact matches (comparing inferred types to ground truth), reports of missing types, accuracy assessments, performance measurements, and coverage analysis of different code constructs and libraries.

Several publicly available datasets are used for evaluating type inference systems in Python:

1. **ManyTypes4Py**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 5,382 Python projects with over 869,000 type annotations. It's specifically designed for machine learning-based type inference and includes a lightweight static analyzer pipeline to extract type information from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets by files.

2. **TypeEvalPy**: A micro-benchmarking framework containing 154 code snippets with 845 type annotations across 18 categories targeting various Python features. It manages the execution of containerized tools, transforms inferred types into standardized formats, and produces meaningful assessment metrics.

3. **Python-150K**: Published by Raychev et al. in 2016, this dataset contains 8,422 Python projects. However, it wasn't collected solely for ML-based type inference tasks, so many projects may lack type annotations.

4. **BetterTypes4Py**: Constructed by selecting a high-quality subset from the ManyTypes4Py dataset, specifically used to train Type4Py.

5. **InferTypes4Py**: A test set derived from the source code of Typilus, Type4Py, and other tools, none of which were used as CodeT5's pre-training data.

Type inference approaches in Python can be categorized into three main groups: rule-based, supervised, and cloze-style approaches. Rule-based methods ensure accuracy but suffer from low coverage due to dynamic features and external calls. Supervised approaches are feature-agnostic and can mitigate coverage problems but require large, high-quality annotated datasets and are limited to pre-defined types. Cloze-style approaches reformulate type inference as a fill-in-the-blank problem using pre-trained code models, though they may ignore domain knowledge from static typing rules.

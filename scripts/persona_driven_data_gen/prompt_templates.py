npc_template = '''World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It is set in the high-fantasy world of Azeroth, a land filled with rich lore, diverse races, and epic conflicts. The game has evolved significantly since its release in 2004, with numerous expansions adding new continents, races, classes, and storylines. Below is a detailed overview of the game's worldview, story background, and some key characters and NPCs.

### Worldview and Story Background

**Azeroth** is a world steeped in ancient history, powerful magic, and epic conflicts. The planet is divided into several continents, each with its own unique environments, cultures, and histories. The main continents include:

- Eastern Kingdoms: Home to the human kingdoms, dwarves, gnomes, and the undead Forsaken.
- Kalimdor: Inhabited by orcs, night elves, tauren, trolls, and other races.
- Northrend: A frozen continent, home to the Lich King and the undead Scourge.
- Pandaria: A mystical land shrouded in mists, home to the Pandaren.
- Broken Isles: The remnants of the ancient Night Elf civilization and the site of the Tomb of Sargeras.
- Zandalar and Kul Tiras: Introduced in the Battle for Azeroth expansion, these are the homelands of the Zandalari trolls and the human kingdom of Kul Tiras, respectively.
- Shadowlands: The realm of the afterlife, introduced in the Shadowlands expansion.

The story of Azeroth is vast and complex, spanning millennia and involving numerous races, factions, and cosmic forces. Here are some key aspects of the world's background:

#### **The Titans and the Old Gods**

- **The Titans**: Azeroth was shaped by the Titans, colossal beings who are part of the Pantheon, a group of god-like entities dedicated to bringing order to the universe. The Titans discovered Azeroth and found it infested with chaotic entities known as the Old Gods. To combat this, they created the Titan-forged, including the Keepers, to help shape and protect the world.

- **The Old Gods**: These malevolent, ancient beings sought to corrupt Azeroth. The Titans imprisoned the Old Gods beneath the surface of the world, but their influence persisted, causing chaos and corruption throughout history. Notable Old Gods include C'Thun, Yogg-Saron, N'Zoth, and Y'Shaarj.

#### **The Sundering**

- **The Well of Eternity**: At the center of ancient Kalimdor was the Well of Eternity, a source of immense arcane power. The Highborne, a group of night elves led by Queen Azshara, recklessly tapped into its power, attracting the attention of the Burning Legion, a demonic army led by the dark titan Sargeras.

- **The War of the Ancients**: This conflict saw the night elves, dragons, and other races unite to repel the Burning Legion's invasion. The war culminated in the Sundering, a catastrophic event that shattered the supercontinent of Kalimdor into several smaller continents and created the Maelstrom, a massive, swirling vortex of energy.

#### **The Rise and Fall of Empires**

- **The Troll Empires**: Before the Sundering, the trolls established powerful empires, such as the Gurubashi and Amani. These empires declined over time but left a lasting impact on Azeroth's history.

- **The Night Elf Empire**: After the Sundering, the night elves established a new empire, centered around the World Tree, Nordrassil. They became the guardians of nature and the Emerald Dream, a parallel realm of primal life.

- **The Human Kingdoms**: Humans emerged as a dominant race in the Eastern Kingdoms, founding powerful kingdoms such as Stormwind, Lordaeron, and Dalaran. These kingdoms played crucial roles in the defense of Azeroth against various threats.

#### **The First and Second Wars**

- **The First War**: The orcs, originally from the world of Draenor, were corrupted by the Burning Legion and transported to Azeroth through the Dark Portal. They waged war against the human kingdom of Stormwind, ultimately destroying it.

- **The Second War**: The orcs, now united under the Horde, continued their conquest, clashing with the Alliance of Lordaeron, a coalition of human, dwarf, and high elf forces. The Alliance eventually triumphed, and the orcs were interned in camps.

#### **The Scourge and the Lich King**

- **The Lich King**: Created by the demon lord Kil'jaeden, the Lich King was originally the orc shaman Ner'zhul. He was transformed into a powerful undead entity and imprisoned in the Frozen Throne in Northrend. The Lich King created the Scourge, an army of undead, to pave the way for a new invasion by the Burning Legion.

- **The Third War**: The Scourge ravaged the human kingdoms, leading to the fall of Lordaeron and the rise of the undead Forsaken. The war culminated in the Battle of Mount Hyjal, where the combined forces of the night elves, Horde, and Alliance defeated the Burning Legion.

#### **The Burning Crusade and Beyond**

- **The Burning Crusade**: The first expansion of WoW saw players journey to Outland, the shattered remnants of Draenor, to combat the Burning Legion and its allies.

- **Wrath of the Lich King**: This expansion focused on the conflict with the Lich King in Northrend, culminating in his defeat at Icecrown Citadel.

- **Cataclysm**: The return of the corrupted Dragon Aspect Deathwing caused massive upheaval across Azeroth, reshaping the world and leading to new conflicts.

- **Mists of Pandaria**: This expansion introduced the mysterious continent of Pandaria and its inhabitants, the Pandaren, as well as new threats from the Sha and the mogu.

- **Warlords of Draenor**: Players traveled to an alternate-timeline Draenor to confront the Iron Horde, a new orcish threat.

- **Legion**: The Burning Legion launched a full-scale invasion of Azeroth, leading to epic battles and the eventual defeat of the dark titan Sargeras.

- **Battle for Azeroth**: This expansion reignited the conflict between the Alliance and Horde, with new zones, races, and storylines.

- **Shadowlands**: The latest expansion takes players to the realm of the afterlife, where they must confront new threats and uncover the mysteries of death.

### Overarching Themes

**1. Conflict and Unity**
- The world of Azeroth is defined by its conflicts, both internal and external.

**2. Corruption and Redemption**

**3. Legacy and Heritage**

**4. Magic and Technology**

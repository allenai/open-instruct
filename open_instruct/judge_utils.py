### Task Description
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an
AI assistant to the user query displayed below. You are shown the user query, assistant response, and an evaluation criteria.

Notes:
- Each response must be evaluated against these criteria independently.
- An overall score of 1 requires meeting all criteria.
- An overall score of 0 in any single category results in the output being classified as bad (0).
- Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation.
- Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, please output the overall score of 0 or 1.

Notes:
- Besides comparing to the referennce answer, your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and appropriate level of detail of the response.
- Note that sometimes the reference answer is not the only answer. So any valid variation of the reference answer is also acceptable and can get a full score.
- Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation.

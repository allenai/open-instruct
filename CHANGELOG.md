# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


### Added
- Add an opt-in tiled GRPO lm-head loss (`--use_liger_grpo_loss`) that recomputes the lm-head projection and loss tile-by-tile to avoid materializing full-vocabulary logits, reproducing the DAPO/CISPO objective with much lower peak memory (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/pull/1735).

### Changed
- Change the default generation `temperature` to 1.0 and make `SamplingConfig.temperature` a required field so `StreamingConfig.temperature` is the single source of truth (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/pull/1725).
- Bump OLMo-core to the latest `main` commit (`9aa3280`) (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/pull/1723).
- Refactor OLMo-core DPO metrics: reduce token-weighted metrics inline in `train_batch` with a single `all_reduce` over the DP group (matching `GRPOTrainModule`), align wandb keys with `dpo_tune_cache.py` (`train_loss`, `logps/*`, `rewards/*`, `perf/mfu_step`, `perf/tokens_per_second_step`/`_total`), add `train/padding_fraction`, `train/sequences_per_rank`, and `train/global_sequences_per_step` metrics, and make `get_num_sequences` always return an `int` (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/pull/1719).
- Add `ModelConfig.loss_implementation` to select olmo-core's LM loss implementation (e.g. `fused_linear` for Liger FLCE), applied in `setup_model` before the model is built (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/pull/1714).

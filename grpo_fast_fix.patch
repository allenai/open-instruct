Fix for queue unit mismatch in grpo_fast.py

The issue appears to be a training step synchronization problem:

1. Data preparation thread: runs steps 1 to num_training_steps
2. Main loop: runs steps resume_training_step to num_training_steps
3. Initial batch is sent as step 1

But there may be a mismatch in how steps are counted or when batches are sent.

Key fixes needed:

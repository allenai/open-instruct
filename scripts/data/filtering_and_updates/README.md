# Data Filtering and Updates Scripts

## Filtering Scripts

* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_special_tokens.py`: Removes special tokens like `<think>`, `</think>`, `<answer>`, `</answer>` from dataset text fields
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_wildchat.py`: Filters Wildchat datasets by removing toxic, redacted examples and keeping only English examples
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_chinese.py`: Filters data with a percentage of characters in the unicode range for Chinese charaters, based on treshold from 0 to 100%.
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_cutoff_date.py`: Removes mentions of knowledge cutoff dates from post-training datasets (e.g., "as my last update in April 2023")
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_cots.py`: Filters datasets for proper thinking token format and answer token format, specifically for reasoner model generations
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_dataset_by_keywords.py`: Removes phrases identifying the model as specific entities (e.g., "I am DeepSeek", "OpenAI", "Claude") from datasets
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_ngram_repetitions.py`: Removes examples with repetitive reasoning/text patterns in post-training datasets, focusing on sentence-level repetition patterns that indicate "unhinged" behavior
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/filter_datasets_sequential.sh`: Shell script that runs keyword filtering followed by cutoff date filtering sequentially
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/update_subsets.py`: Loads base dataset, removes unwanted sources, adds additional datasets, removes columns, and pushes combined dataset

## Testing

* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/test_filter_ngram_repetitions.py`: Comprehensive test suite for the n-gram repetition filtering functionality
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/run_tests.py`: Test runner that executes all test files in the directory
* `scripts/data/filtering_and_updates/TEST_README.md`: Detailed documentation for running tests and test coverage

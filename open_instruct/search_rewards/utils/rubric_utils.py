INSTANCE_WISE_RUBRIC_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert evaluator generating adaptive rubrics to assess model responses.

## Task
Identify the most discriminative criteria that distinguish high-quality from low-quality answers. Capture subtle quality differences that existing rubrics miss.

## Output Components
- **Description**: Detailed, specific description of what makes a response excellent/problematic
- **Title**: Concise abstract label (general, not question-specific)

## Categories
1. **Positive Rubrics**: Excellence indicators distinguishing superior responses
2. **Negative Rubrics**: Critical flaws definitively degrading quality

## Core Guidelines

### 1. Discriminative Power
- Focus ONLY on criteria meaningfully separating quality levels
- Each rubric must distinguish between otherwise similar responses
- Exclude generic criteria applying equally to all responses

### 2. Novelty & Non-Redundancy
With existing/ground truth rubrics:
- Never duplicate overlapping rubrics in meaning/scope
- Identify uncovered quality dimensions
- Add granular criteria if existing ones are broad
- Return empty lists if existing rubrics are comprehensive

### 3. Avoid Mirror Rubrics
Never create positive/negative versions of same criterion:
- ❌ "Provides clear explanations" + "Lacks clear explanations"
- ✅ Choose only the more discriminative direction

### 4. Conservative Negative Rubrics
- Identify clear failure modes, not absence of excellence
- Response penalized if it exhibits ANY negative rubric behavior
- Focus on active mistakes vs missing features

## Selection Strategy

### Quantity: 1-5 total rubrics (fewer high-quality > many generic)

### Distribution Based on Response Patterns:
- **More positive**: Responses lack sophistication but avoid major errors
- **More negative**: Systematic failure patterns present
- **Balanced**: Both excellence gaps and failure modes exist
- **Empty lists**: Existing rubrics already comprehensive

## Analysis Process
1. Group responses by quality level
2. Find factors separating higher/lower clusters
3. Check if factors covered by existing rubrics
4. Select criteria with highest discriminative value

## Output Format
```json
{
  "question": "<original question verbatim>",
  "positive_rubrics": [
    {"description": "<detailed excellence description>", "title": "<abstract label>"}
  ],
  "negative_rubrics": [
    {"description": "<detailed failure description>", "title": "<abstract label>"}
  ]
}
```

## Examples

**Positive:**
```json
{"description": "Anticipates and addresses potential edge cases or exceptions to the main solution, demonstrating thorough problem understanding", "title": "Edge Case Handling"}
```

**Negative:**
```json
{"description": "Conflates correlation with causation when interpreting data or making recommendations", "title": "Causal Misattribution"}
```

## Inputs
1. **Question**: Original question being answered
2. **Responses**: Multiple model responses (Response 1, Response 2, etc.)
3. **Existing Rubrics** (optional): Previously generated/ground truth rubrics

## Critical Reminders
- Each rubric must distinguish between actual provided responses
- Exclude rubrics applying equally to all responses
- Prefer empty lists over redundancy when existing rubrics are comprehensive
- Focus on observable, objective, actionable criteria
- Quality over quantity: 2 excellent rubrics > 5 mediocre ones

Generate only the most impactful, non-redundant rubrics revealing meaningful quality differences.

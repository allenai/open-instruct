# Bash commands
- `uv run pytest`: Run the tests.
- `make style && make quality` run the linter + formatter.
- `uv run mkdocs serve`: View the documentation locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- `uv run mkdocs build`: Build the documentation to the `site/` directory.

# Workflow
- Always run the linter and make sure the tests pass before finishing a task.
- Prefer running single tests, not the whole suite, when developing.
- To launch experiment scripts, use the `build_image_and_launch.sh` script, like this: `./scripts/train/build_image_and_launch.sh $SOME_SCRIPT`.
- For GRPO, we have three test scripts:
  - `scripts/train/debug/single_gpu_on_beaker.sh`, which is single GPU without any tools. It should run in ~8 minutes.
  - `scripts/train/debug/tool_grpo_fast.sh`, which is single GPU with tools. It should run in ~15 minutes.
  - `scripts/train/debug/large_test_script.sh`, which uses two 8x GPU nodes without tools. It should run in 32 minutes.
- For DPO, we have two test scripts:
  - `scripts/train/debug/dpo.sh`, which is a single GPU script.
  - `scripts/train/debug/large_dpo.sh`, which uses 4 nodes.
- To run the `./scripts/train/build_image_and_launch.sh` script, you must commit the current changes.
- Launch tool use experiments by running `./scripts/train/build_image_and_launch.sh scripts/train/debug/tool_grpo_fast.sh`.
- Launch multi-node non-tool experiments by running `./scripts/train/build_image_and_launch.sh scripts/train/debug/large_test_script.sh`.
- Launch the GPU tests with `./scripts/train/build_image_and_launch.sh scripts/train/debug/run_gpu_tests.sh`.

# Documentation
To verify that documentation changes don't alter the generated output:
1. Build docs on your branch: `uv run mkdocs build && cp -r site site-branch`
2. Switch to main branch and build: `cd /path/to/main && uv run mkdocs build`
3. Compare the builds: `diff -rq site-branch /path/to/main/site`
4. If no output, the docs are identical. If differences exist, review with: `diff -r site-branch /path/to/main/site`

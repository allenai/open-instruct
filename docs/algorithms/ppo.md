# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)



## Implemented Variants

- `open_instruct/grpo_vllm_thread_ray_gtrl.py` contains the script for training PPO models.



## `ppo_vllm_thread_ray_gtrl.py`


This implementation has the following features:

- Uses a thread-based approach to parallelize the training and inference processes, based on [Asynchronous RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252).
- Uses vLLM and Ray to parallelize the training process, based on how [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF) does it



### Debug (Single GPU)

You can run the script in a single GPU mode to debug the training process.

```bash
bash scripts/train/debug/ppo.sh
```



### Reproduce `allenai/Llama-3.1-Tulu-3.1-8B` (2 Nodes)

You can reproduce our `allenai/Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-8B` model by running the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/train/tulu3/ppo_8b.sh
```

### Quality of life tools


Note that when running with `--push_to_hub` and `--with_tracking`, the HF repo is automatically tracked to wandb, so we link the tracked run and the trained model.

Furthermore, we also track the dataset length visualization in wandb (see detail in [here](#dataset-processing))

Finally, we also include samples

### Training Metrics

During training, the following metrics are logged:


* `episode`: the global episode number training has gone through (e.g., `3000` means we have trained on 3000 data points already -- in the case of RLVR that is prompts, which can repeat)
* `lr`: the current learning rate
* `epoch`: the fraction or multiple of the epoch (e.g., `2.7` means we have trained on the dataset for 2 epochs and 70% of the third epoch)
* `objective/kl`: the KL divergence between the current policy and the reference policy (sum of the KL divergence of each response token)
* `objective/scores`: the scores of the current response, rated by a combination of reward model and other rewards (e.g., R1 style format reward, verifiable reward, etc.)
* `objective/rlhf_reward`: the RLHF reward, which is `objective/scores` - `beta` * `objective/kl`
* `objective/non_score_reward`: `beta` * `objective/kl`
* `objective/entropy`: the entropy of the current policy
* `objective/loss`: the PPO loss
* `objective/verifiable_correct_rate`: the rate at which responses are verifiably correct, providing a measure of response accuracy
* `loss/policy_avg`: the average policy loss, indicating the mean loss incurred during policy updates
* `policy/approxkl_avg`: the average approximate KL divergence, used to monitor policy stability
* `policy/clipfrac_avg`: the average fraction of updates where the policy was clipped, indicating how often clipping occurs
* `policy/entropy_avg`: the average entropy of the policy, providing a measure of policy randomness
* `time/from_scratch`: the time taken to train the model from scratch
* `time/training`: the time taken to do one training step
* `val/sequence_lengths`: the length of the sequences in the generated responses
* `val/num_stop_token_ids`: the number of stop tokens in the generated responses




## Implementation details

These are relevant implementation details on reward modeling:

1. The tokenizer pads from the left, so it's straightforward to do generations.
1. Disable dropout in the model: this is an implementation detail in PPO training (see p.3. in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593).
1. Layer initialization: we initialize the score's weight according to `std=1 / np.sqrt(model.config.hidden_size + 1)` (see p. 11 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325)
1. Vocab size for RM and Policy: we use the same vocab size for the reward model and the policy model. This is to ensure that the reward model can score all the tokens in the policy model. We added a `ValueError` for situations when `policy.config.vocab_size != reward_model.config.vocab_size`.
1. Retrain on the same prompts: say we only have 10k prompts but we specified `--episodes 100k`, we will shuffle the prompts at every 10k episodes and retrain on them.
1. Truncate responses at the stop token: we truncate the responses at the `--stop_token eos` to ensure the generation is stopped at the stop token.
1. Non-stop penalty: we use a non-stop penalty to the reward model to penalize the model for not stopping at the stop token. For example, if the model does not end at the stop token, we penalize the model by `-10.0` (see `--penalty_reward_value -10.0`).
1. Async training and generation: we follow the architecture in https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00036 to do rollout and training asynchronously. This is to ensure that the training is not bottlenecked by the generation.

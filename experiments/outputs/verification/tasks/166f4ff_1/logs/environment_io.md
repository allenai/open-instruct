### Environment Interaction 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```python
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to complete a task in AppWorld with task_id 166f4ff_1. They tried using the appworld function, but there was a NameError because 'appworld' wasn't defined. Hmm, maybe the code they tried wasn't properly structured. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the appworld function is supposed to be called with an api_code parameter. The initial attempt was to run appworld.run_task(task_id), but that's not valid Python code. The error says 'appworld' isn't defined, which suggests that the code isn't correctly formatted.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use the appworld tool as a function, but the code needs to be written properly. For example, the code should be a string that represents the Python code to execute. So perhaps the correct api_code is something like "appworld.run_task(task_id)" but that's still not valid because 'appworld' isn't defined.

Alternatively, maybe the task requires a different approach. Maybe the user needs to use the appworld tool's API in a different way

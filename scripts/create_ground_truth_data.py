        "cot_answer": "There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. So the answer is 6.",

        "cot_answer": "Jason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 - 12 = 8. So the answer is 8.",

        "cot_answer": "There were originally 9 computers. For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added. 9 + 20 is 29. So the answer is 29.",

If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}",

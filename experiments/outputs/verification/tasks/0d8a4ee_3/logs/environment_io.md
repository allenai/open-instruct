### Environment Interaction 3

```python
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to complete a task in AppWorld with task_id 0d8a4ee_3. The first attempt used the appworld function with a code that prints task_id, but that caused a NameError because task_id wasn't defined. So the problem is that the code doesn't have access to the task_id variable.

Hmm, maybe the task_id is supposed to be part of the api_code. Let me think. The task_id is provided as a parameter, but the api_code needs to reference it. Wait, in Python, variables must be defined in the scope where they're used. If the code isn't defined, it'll throw an error.

So the correct approach is to include the task_id in the api_code. But how? The user might have expected the code to use the task_id variable. So the api_code should have something like task_id = "0d8a4ee_3" or similar. But without knowing the actual task, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the task is to run a script that processes the task_id. For example, if the task is to check if the task is completed,
